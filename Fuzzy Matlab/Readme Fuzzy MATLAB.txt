[Readme Fuzzy MATLAB]

---

In this folder it is possible to find MATLAB code (in .fis format) concerning:

- Alfa or Input Parameters Availability (starting from aleatory/epistemic uncertainty                                          sources)  (alfa.fis);-  Beta Availability (starting from Model Structure aleatory/epistemic uncertainty sources + Alfa)  (beta.fis);- Chi or Overall Availability (starting from Model Context aleatory/epistemic uncertainty sources + Beta)  (overall.fis).

Just import and run the files in a MATLAB environment with the Fuzzy Toolbox available.
It is possible to modify membership functions/rules to achieve different results.
