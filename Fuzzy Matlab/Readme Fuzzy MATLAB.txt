[Readme Fuzzy MATLAB]

---

In this folder it is possible to find MATLAB code (in .fis format) concerning:

- Input Parameters Availability (starting from uncertainty sources) - (inputParameters.fis)
- Model Context Availability (starting from uncertainty sources) - (modelContext.fis)
- Model Structure Availability (starting from uncertainty sources) - (modelStructure.fis)

- Overall Availability (startig from the three computed before) - (overallAvailability.fis)

---

Just import and run the files in a MATLAB environment with the Fuzzy Toolbox available.
It is possible to modify membership functions/rules to achieve different results.
